# CarNavigationSystem

This project is the final assignment for an undergraduate coursework I took called 'Computer Seminar I' where I have to combine all the alogrithms (shrotest path search, sort, etc.) and tools (OpenGL) that was introduced and to add some unique and creative features to the main program. This project was written in C language and was done from December 2018 - January 2019. 

Here's what the direction feature looks like:

### Code Files

* `main.c` - the main program file.
* `main` - the compiled program.
* `map.dat` - the map file.
* `makefile` - to make/build the program.
* `Roboto-Black.tiff` - font used in the program.
* `freetype2` - library to render text into the program.

### Future Updates

Since the tools provided are quite old and outdated, I plan to upgrade the program by re-writting it in C++ and newest version of OpenGL ðŸ‘€.
